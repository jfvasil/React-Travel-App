# Wanderlust

Welcome to Travel Explorer, a React.js travel app developed by John Vasil. This project is a passion-driven endeavor that combines my love for travel with my desire to practice and enhance my skills in React.js. The app aims to assist users who are uncertain about their next travel destination by asking a series of questions and providing them with a suggested location along with relevant information.
